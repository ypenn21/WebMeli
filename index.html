    <h1>To my dearest...</h1><br><br>

    <p>Yannito mi amor, <br><br> 

        I'm happy to be sharing this Colombian special day with you, even in the distance. I'm not used to writting letters and I don't have the incredible writting skills that you have but I thought I should give it a try. So, this is a piece of me showing you that I'm being honest and that I don't know how to do tech stuff. Mostly because this page was created, produced and designed by a close friend of mine, who was really sweet to help me build it. I tried to do it by myself but as you can imagine those skills skip my gens for this time. <br><br>
        
        I guess, what I wanted to do with this was: First, make you laugh cause I know you would be. And Second, to show you that we can communicate and understand in different ways. And that no distance can't with the miracles of the internet lol.<br><br>
        
        
        Anyways, mi abuelito. Feliz d√≠a, muchos besitos </p>
